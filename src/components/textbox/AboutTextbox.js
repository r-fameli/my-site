            Hi! Thank you for checking out my site! <br />
            
            My name’s Riki. I’m a junior studying Computer Science at Brown University. 
            Most of my experience lies in web development and user service, but I am currently teaching myself web design. 
            Outside of class and work, I perform with the aerial arts team and am also interested in calisthenics and dance!
